		<h2>Minecraft</h2>

		<h3>What is Minecraft?</h3>
			<p>
			Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. In it, a player can build 
			anything. The game which has been described as like an ‘online Lego’ involves building 
			blocks and creating structures across different environments and terrains. The worlds 
			are randomly generated and infinte, furthering adding to the "infinite possibilities" 
			that many players love about the game. Within those worlds, the main functions include 
			resource gathering, crafting items, building, and combat as the baseline. 
		<h3>Why do I like it?</h3>
			<p>
			Minecraft is one of those games I've been playing since childhood. I started out 
			with the Xbox 360 version, and it was the first proper video game I got into using 
			that console. I'm more of the builder type. Since the beginning, I've loved letting 
			my imagination run wild and build anything I wanted. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Minecraft is available on mobile, console, and PC. For the PC version, you can download it <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download" />here</a>.

		<h3>What is Pokemon?</h3>
			<p>
			 Pokemon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle 
			 other monsters in a quest to become the best. Pokémon are divided into types, 
			 such as water and fire, each with different strengths. Battles between them can 
			 be likened to the simple hand game rock-paper-scissors as it's all turn-based. With 
			 experience, Pokémon grow stronger and gain new moves. And some can change form by evolving.
			 By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges, trainers garner acclaim to become 
			 the Pokemon champion of that region. 
		<h3>Why do I like it?</h3>
			<p>
			There's this level of charm and appeal that Pokemon has that other modern day franchises lack.
			For me, it's the fact you can find, catch, and raise this little monsters up yourself, forming
			some level of attachment and fondness. While I've never been a huge fan of the turn-based battle
			system, finding it a bit tedious, my favorite part of any Pokemon game is always discovering all 
			the Pokemon in that region.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pokemon is available on mobile as <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/?hl=en" />Pokemon Go</a>, 
			the <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/pokemon" />Nintendo Switch console</a>, and PC as emulators. 
			For the PC version with emulators, my favorite is Pokemon MMO. You can download it <a href="https://pokemmo.com/downloads/" />here</a>.
